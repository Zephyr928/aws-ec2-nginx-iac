# aws-ec2-ansible

**Getting started**

1. Setup EC2 instance and Security Groups
2. Configure Terraform to provision servers

**Done so far**
1. Provisioned an Amazon Linux server and installed Ansible on it.
2. Configured awscli on Ansible server
3. Created place holder files for both Ansible and Terraform
4. Configured the terraform/main.tf (Need to go back and look at Production IP cidr block and SSH keys)


**To-Do List**
1. Figure out what production IP addresses will be.  Once decided edit the terraform/main.tf file and change the Security Group cidr_blocks to production IP's.
2. Figure out what Key Pairs I need for the terraform/main.tf file.
